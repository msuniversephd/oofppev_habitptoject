# Habit Tracker App

A Python-based command-line application for tracking and managing daily habits. The project includes Jupyter Notebooks for habit tracking and streak analysis along with Python scripts for habit tracking and testing functionalities.

The Habit Tracker App is designed to empower users to track their daily habits, storing the data for future reference and analysis. The project comprises the following components:

- `habit_tracker.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for habit tracking.
- `habit_tracking.py`: Python script managing the tracking of habits and data storage.
- `habit_streaking.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing streaks.
- `test.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with a suite of test cases to validate the functionality of the Habit Tracker.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. The Jupyter Notebooks require Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. For the Python scripts, ensure Python is installed. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.


## Usage


## Jupyter Notebooks

- Use `habit_tracker.ipynb` for interactive habit tracking.
- Utilize `habit_streaking.ipynb` for streak analysis.
-Use ´test.ipynb for testing.

## Python script

- Run `habit_tracking.py` to track habits, mark their completion, and save the data to a CSV file.
## Functionality
## Habit Tracking

- Allows input of habits, dates, and completion status.
- Stores tracked data in a structured format (habit, date, done).
- Saves the data to a CSV file for future reference.


## Jupyter Notebooks

- Use `habit_tracker.ipynb` for interactive habit tracking.
- Utilize `habit_streaking.ipynb` for streak analysis.
-Use ´test.ipynb for testing.

## How to Run the Project


1. **Habit Tracking - Python Script:** Run `python habit_tracking.py`.
2. **Interactive Habit Tracking - Jupyter Notebook:** Open `habit_tracker.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Streak Analysis - Jupyter Notebook:** Open `habit_streaking.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
4. **Testing - Jupyter Notebook:** Open `test.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

## Planned Features

- Integrate graphical analysis for habit tracking.
- Implement user authentication for individual habit tracking.

## Testing


The `test.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook includes a suite of test cases for the Habit Tracker functionality. Run this file to validate the performance and functionality of the Habit Tracker.
